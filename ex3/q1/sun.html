    <h1>This is the Sun</h1>
    <p>The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a massive, nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy from its surface mainly as visible light and infrared radiation with 10% at ultraviolet energies.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The Sun is about 4.6 billion years old.</li>
        <li>It is composed primarily of hydrogen (about 74%) and helium (about 24%).</li>
        <li>The Sun's diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers (864,000 miles).</li>
        <li>It takes approximately 8 minutes and 20 seconds for light from the Sun to reach Earth.</li>
        <li>The Sun's surface temperature is about 5,500 degrees Celsius (9,932 degrees Fahrenheit).</li>
        <li>The Sun generates energy through nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium in its core.</li>
        <li>It has a powerful magnetic field and experiences solar phenomena such as sunspots, solar flares, and coronal mass ejections.</li>
    </ul>
